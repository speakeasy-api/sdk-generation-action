  mode:
    description: |-
      The mode to run the workflow in when using the 'generate' action, valid options are 'direct' or 'pr', defaults to 'direct'.
      This is intended to be used along with the `action` input to determine the current action step to run.
        - 'direct' mode will generally create a branch to generate the SDK on then merge this directly to the branch the workflow is configure to run on (normally 'main' or 'master') after compilation is successful.
        - 'pr' will create a branch to generate the SDK on then create a pull request to merge this branch to the branch the workflow is configure to run on (normally 'main' or 'master') after compilation is successful.
      See documentation for more details.
    default: "direct"
    required: false
  action:
    description: |-
      The current action step to run, valid options are 'run-workflow', 'release', or 'tag', defaults to 'run-workflow'.
      This is intended to be used along with the `mode` input to determine the current action step to run.
        - 'run-workflow' will generate the SDK and commit the changes to the branch.
        - 'release' will create a release on Github.
        - 'tag' will tag the registry images with the provided tags.
