name: Speakeasy Client SDK Generation Action
description: The Speakeasy Generation Action isto be run via the workflows provided in this repo and is not intended to be run directly.
inputs:
  speakeasy_version:
    description: The version of the Speakeasy CLI to use or "latest"
    default: latest
    required: false
  openapi_doc_location:
    description: The location of the OpenAPI document to use, either a relative path within the repo or a URL to a publicly hosted document
    required: false
    deprecationMessage: "This input is deprecated, please use the `openapi_docs` input instead."
  openapi_doc_auth_header:
    description: |-
      The auth header to use when fetching the OpenAPI document if it is not publicly hosted. For example `Authorization`.
      If using a private speakeasy hosted document use `x-api-key`. This header will be populated with the openapi_doc_auth_token provided.
    required: false
  openapi_doc_auth_token:
    description: The auth token to use when fetching the OpenAPI document if it is not publicly hosted. For example `Bearer <token>` or `<token>`.
    required: false
  openapi_docs:
    description: |-
      A yaml string containing a list of OpenAPI documents to use, if multiple documents are provided they will be merged together, prior to generation.

      If the document lives within the repo a relative path can be provided, if the document is hosted publicly a URL can be provided.

      If the documents are hosted privately a URL can be provided along with the `openapi_doc_auth_header` and `openapi_doc_auth_token` inputs.
      Each document will be fetched using the provided auth header and token, so they need to be valid for all documents.

      For example:
      openapi_docs: |
        - https://example.com/openapi1.json
        - https://example.com/openapi2.json
    required: false
  openapi_doc_output:
    description: "The path to output the modified OpenAPI spec"
    required: false
    default: "./openapi.yaml"
  github_access_token:
    description: A GitHub access token with write access to the repo
    required: true
  languages:
    description: |-
      A yaml string containing a list of languages to generate SDKs for example:
      languages: |
        - go: ./go-sdk # specifying a output directory
        - python # using default output of ./python-client-sdk
        - typescript # using default output of ./typescript-client-sdk
        - java # using default output of ./java-client-sdk
        - php # using default output of ./php-client-sdk
        - ruby # using default output of ./ruby-client-sdk

      If multiple languages are present we will treat this repo as a mono repo, if a single language is present as a single language repo and generate the sdk
      in the root of the repo if not path is provided.

  max_suggestions:
    description: "The maximum number of suggestions to apply when using the 'suggest' action step."
    default: "5"
    required: false
  mode:
    description: |-
      The mode to run the workflow in when using the 'generate' action, valid options are 'direct' or 'pr', defaults to 'direct'.
      This is intended to be used along with the `action` input to determine the current action step to run.
        - 'direct' mode will generally create a branch to generate the SDK on then merge this directly to the branch the workflow is configure to run on (normally 'main' or 'master') after compilation is successful.
        - 'pr' will create a branch to generate the SDK on then create a pull request to merge this branch to the branch the workflow is configure to run on (normally 'main' or 'master') after compilation is successful.
      See documentation for more details.
    default: "direct"
    required: false
  action:
    description: |-
      The current action step to run, valid options are 'validate', 'generate', 'suggest', 'finalize', 'finalize-suggestion', or 'release', defaults to 'generate'.
      This is intended to be used along with the `mode` input to determine the current action step to run.
        - 'validate' will validate the OpenAPI document and return addressable warnings and errors.
        - 'generate' will generate the SDK and commit the changes to the branch.
        - 'suggest' will apply suggestions to the OpenAPI document and commit the changes to the branch.
        - 'finalize' depending on mode will either merge the branch to the branch the workflow is configure to run on (normally 'main' or 'master') or create a pull request.
        - 'finalize-suggestion' will create a pull request with the suggestions from the LLM model.
        - 'release' will create a release on Github.
